This design document is based on the **Personal Finance iOS App** concept by Fireart Studio. The design emphasizes a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic combined with high-contrast data visualization to make complex financial information digestible and engaging.

# Design Documentation: Personal Finance iOS App

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this application is to provide users with a centralized, visually intuitive dashboard for tracking personal wealth, managing bank cards, and monitoring spending habits. The design prioritizes clarity, modern aesthetics, and quick-action accessibility.

## 2. Visual Strategy

### 2.1 Color Palette

* **Primary (Action):** Vivid Electric Green (`#C6FF00` approx.) — Used for primary CTAs, positive trends, and active states.
* **Secondary (Dark Mode Base):** Deep Charcoal/Black (`#0D0D0D`) — Provides a premium, high-contrast background that makes data "pop."
* **Accents:** Cyber Purple and Soft Blues — Used in gradients on credit card assets and data charts to differentiate categories.
* **Typography Neutral:** Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) for headers and Off-Gray (`#8E8E93`) for secondary metadata.

### 2.2 Typography

* **Font Family:** San Francisco (System UI) or a similar geometric Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter).
* **Styles:**
* **Large Titles:** Bold, high-contrast for "Total Balance" figures.
* **Subheaders:** Medium weight, uppercase for category labels (e.g., "MY CARDS").
* **Body:** Regular weight for transaction details and dates.



### 2.3 Key UI Elements

* **Glassmorphism:** Use of background blur and semi-transparent overlays on card elements to create depth.
* **Rounded Corners:** High corner radius (approx. 24pt–32pt) on containers and buttons to maintain a friendly, modern mobile feel.
* **Tactile Cards:** Credit cards are rendered with subtle gradients and "glass" textures to mimic physical premium cards.

## 3. Information Architecture & Screens

### 3.1 Dashboard (Home)

* **Total Balance Header:** Centralized focus on net worth with a "percentage growth" indicator.
* **Horizontal Card Carousel:** Allows users to swipe through multiple linked bank accounts/cards.
* **Quick Actions:** Floating or prominent buttons for "Transfer," "Pay," and "Top Up."

### 3.2 Analytics & Statistics

* **Line/Area Charts:** Smooth, bezier-curved graphs showing spending trends over time.
* **Category Breakdown:** Circular progress rings or icon-based lists showing where money is spent (e.g., Shopping, Food, Transport).

### 3.3 Transaction History

* **Categorized List:** Grouped by date with high-quality icons for vendors.
* **Amount Indicators:** Distinct color coding for outflows (white/gray) vs. inflows (green).

## 4. Interaction Design

* **Micro-interactions:** Smooth transitions when swiping between cards in the carousel.
* **Haptic Feedback:** Short vibrations when a transaction is confirmed or a card is swapped.
* **Gestures:** Downward swipe to refresh data; horizontal swipe on transactions to reveal "Archive" or "Delete" options.

## 5. Design Principles Applied

1. **Hierarchy:** The most important information (Balance) is the largest element on the screen.
2. **Contrast:** The neon green against the dark background ensures that the most important action items are immediately visible even in low light.
3. **Consistency:** Iconography follows a consistent "Line Art" style with uniform stroke weights.

## 6. Implementation Notes for Developers

* **Blur Effects:** Use `UIVisualEffectView` (iOS) or `BackdropFilter` (Flutter) to achieve the glassmorphism look.
* **Gradients:** Use linear gradients for cards to avoid a flat look.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure the neon green text meets WCAG contrast ratios against dark backgrounds for readability.
